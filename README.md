<br />
<br />

## 4. Your app should be located under this directory in Finder:
<br />
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/{your app}/Build/Products/Debug/{Project Name}.app
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

(If your having issues try quiting the app. Xcode autoruns it on build. Then you can copy/paste it to a better location in Finder.)
